                Your  love, guidance, and support are the reason why i continue on living and pursuing things that i want to do. 
                The countless memories we've shared, from moments of laughter to lessons I have learned. 
                You've shown me the true meaning of strength, kindness, and dedication, and I am always proud to be your child. 
                Thank you for always being there for me. You have shaped me into the person I am today, and for that, I am forever grateful.
